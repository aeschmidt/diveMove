* Work on MLE (or better) method for modelling mixtures of 3 Poisson
   processes for dive bout identification.
* Find a way to embed R graphics in tcltk widgets for plotTD().
* Complete the vignette with bout detection examples.
* Check whether functions to extract parts of a track corresponding to
   diving period interpolations should be included here.
* For TDRs without salt-water switch, consider how to identify dry periods
   based on concurrent data.
